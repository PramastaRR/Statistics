# Statistics
a ~~simple~~ program is used to compute the distribution of the data.

This program is devoted to fulfil my college assignment, Statistics.

The default data in the program are created from [here](https://github.com/Z-Fikar/country-data/blob/master/src/country-avg-male-height.json).
```
li = [170.2, 171.3, 176.3, 177.0, 172.0, 165.6, 176.6, 169.5, 160.3, 170.0,
      174.3, 169.2, 168.3, 169.5, 177.6, 178.3, 170.4, 178.8, 170.3, 175.8,
      177.1, 178.4, 174.1, 170.0, 177.4, 169.8, 175.7, 168.5, 175.3, 179.8,
      162.3, 161.5, 170.6, 165.4, 175.0, 175.0, 173.2, 172.8, 168.6, 174.2,
      175.0, 178.0, 166.0, 166.0, 172.5, 167.5, 166.4, 170.7, 181.0, 175.5,
      165.0, 163.8, 179.7, 167.0, 169.0, 164.3, 162.0, 176.0, 170.5, 172.0,
      175.0, 173.0, 176.5, 166.6, 178.1, 170.0, 171.0, 172.0, 166.0, 179.3,
      176.5, 171.0, 169.3, 166.4, 170.3, 174.1, 175.0, 175.4, 176.4, 171.8,
      173.4, 169.0, 162.1
      ]
```

If you want to input a new set of data use this function.
###masuk([*Path*])
As [*Path*] is the address that refers to a File that consist the new data. By default, you still can enter the data one by one manually.
The data in the File must be separated by a new line as the program can only read them per line. <br> e. g. [contoh_Data.txt](https://github.com/Z-Fikar/Statistics/blob/master/contoh_data.txt):
```
170.2
171.3
176.3
177.0
...
169.0
162.1
```
